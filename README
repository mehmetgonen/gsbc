This repository contains R implementation of the algorithms proposed in "Discriminating early- and late-stage cancers using multiple kernel learning on gene sets", which is appearing in the Proceedings of ISMB 2018.

run_pathological_classification_random_forest_tcga.R shows how to replicate random forest experiments on TCGA cohorts.
run_pathological_classification_svm_tcga.R shows how to replicate support vector machine experiments on TCGA cohorts.
run_pathological_classification_unweighted_mkl_tcga.R shows how to replicate unweighted MKL experiments on TCGA cohorts.
run_pathological_classification_group_lasso_mkl_tcga.R shows how to replicate group Lasso MKL experiments on TCGA cohorts.
